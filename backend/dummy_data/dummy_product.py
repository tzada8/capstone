And the stream is even limited to 720p60 through the USB. This is just awful outdated charging technology. On a $900 camera i think its fair to expect it to be used in the use cases they advertise.",

      "text": "Like most of us, I wear multiple hats at work.  One of those is shooting, editing, and directing promotional videos, training videos, and marketing products across multiple channels. I would not consider myself a true \u201cprofessional\u201d in the technical sense but the products I produce are and they have to be!  I shoot with portable action cameras, drones, stationary rigs and have been trending to even include an iPhone depending on the job (which is crazy to think they are that good these days). Too many cameras!!!!\n\nLast year, in an attempt to simplify, I got my first reach into the mirrorless vlog cameras with another brand but due to no image stability,  I kept going back to other cameras.  I was really hoping to have the \u201cone camera\u201d that could do it all for me.  AND I THINK I HAVE FOUND IT!!\n\nOut of the box I was shocked by how small a footprint it has\u2026I love that... the more I can do with one camera the better. Small footprint but a huge capacity in the quality and capability of this camera.\nI love how Sony laid out the User Interface.  The photo button is easy to feel and differentiate from the video button without having my eyes leave the shot.  I can grab a pic and move to video and back with touch only.  I really like that.  The menu button is easy and intuitive and the selector wheel both navigates left and right and up and down with a press to that respective corner and spins to flow through media or frame to frame depending on if you are playing a video back.  So handy and helpful.  \n\nThe screen is absolutely gorgeous and true to tone.  What I see on screen is what the video looks like on my monitors. Crisp and clear.  Skin tones are amazing! It\u2019s also a touch screen and you can navigate through all the menus or utilize it for a quick setting change.  The screen rotates firmly and confidently and makes a great monitor (which you can\u2019t do with a phone as easy and still have the image quality that the ZV-1M2 can give you).  I also absolutely love the red bar around the screen to let you know without mistake that you are rolling video.  So much better than a small blinking red light ect.  I also really appreciate the thought into the zoom lever\u2026very accessible and feels great to the touch but the part that really gets it for me is just how smooth and the speed they chose to assign to the zoom.  Not too fast and not too slow\u2026just what I would do in a post-production normally but now I can do it real time.  It\u2019s that professional touch that really makes this camera top-tier. \n\nThe audio quality was a tremendous surprise!  I mean I cannot believe just how good the audio is with just the native mic!  Exceptional.  Crips and clear with full tones. The video quality is by far the best I have seen.  The images are so crisp and clear even at 1080!  The 4 K is ridiculous good.\nI also really love the real-time autofocus tracking and eye tracking. The final huge win for me is Sony\u2019s Image stabilization with this camera.  It feels like it\u2019s on an expensive gimbal! Butter smooth!  Like an action camera but with the quality of a full-size rig!  So many creative features and modes to play with awesome slow motion and time-lapse for great transitions shots ect.  I really can\u2019t think of anything I don\u2019t love about this camera\u2026even the battery life is on point!  I LOVE this camera!!!  And for all the features 4K ect ect\u2026 I absolutely LOVE it because it makes my job easier\u2026 It makes my content look like a highly-paid production house made it. It\u2019s going to be my go-to camera for everything when it comes to content creation. Just amazing!\n\nNote: Be sure to buy the Sony Vlog creator kit.  Soon as I got the camera, I had to run up to BestBuy to get the Stick.  It\u2019s truly a must have with this camera!!!",
